Marks and Spencer results likely to add to the High Street gloom
  
Fears are growing that Marks & Spencer could disappoint when it delivers its first-half results early next month.
It has been a dire year on the High Street amid the squeeze on shoppers’ income.
The unusually warm weather in September is likely to have added to clothing retailers’ woes, stifling demand for autumnal ranges.

This all bodes badly for M&S’s half-year numbers, due on November 8. Analysts expect six-month profits to have tumbled 11 per cent to £311m from £349m last year. 
Boss Marc Bolland has plans to boost sales by ploughing £600m into its stores over the next three years.
 
But the results of the new strategy are expected to take time to pay dividends. Fraser Ramzan, analyst at Nomura, estimates M&S clothing and homewares sales dropped 2.4 per cent in the second quarter, having been flat in the first quarter.
He has also taken his red pen to his full-year profit forecast, cutting it to £692m from £724m. 
He said: ‘In essence petrol and utilities have floored our estimates while the Bolland plan has yet to take effect.’ 
Shares fell 3.2p to 329p. Next (down 54p to 2557p) will publish third quarter sales figures next Wednesday. 
Analysts are braced for a weak performance at its stores and a slowdown at its Directory arm.
